    "The object of the game is to guess the day's 5-Letter word within 6 tries.  After each try the game provides feedback about how close your guess was to the target word.  Green letters are correct guesses, Yellow letters signify that the letter appears in the word but not in that location, and Gray letters are letters which are not in the word at all.  Using this feedback you can make better and better guesses until you correctly guess the target word.  In the hardmode variant of the game once a letter is correctly guessed (either yellow or green) you must use those letters in all subsequent guesses.  For example suppose that the word that we are trying to guess is HOUSE and for our first guess we guess SAUCE."

    "From this letter count information we can calculate a numerical word score for each 5-letter word in the list.  The word with the highest word score will be our next guess.  One problem that we haven't considered yet is what to do with words which have a repeated letter.  For example the word TENET is composed of letters with a high frequency but only has 3 unique letters and as such doesnt make a good first guess as it gives less overall information than a word like RANCH which has letters with lower frequency counts but no repeated letters.  One way that we can deal with this problem is by multiplying the word score by the number of unique letters in the word for the first couple of rounds of guesses.  A first approach then could be to calculate a word score by adding together the total letter counts of each letter appearing in the word and then multiplying the sum by the number of unique letters in the word.  For our two examples TENET and RANCH this would give:\n",
