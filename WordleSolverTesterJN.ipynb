    "# Algorithm for Collecting Wordle Solver Data\n",
    "Now that we have a method for generating word scores for possible Wordle solution guesses we can create a method for testing the accuracy of our solver by collecting data on the number of required guesses for the algorithm version against a list of Wordle solutions.  In order to do this we need a code to compare the current guess to a solution word and generate the gray, yellow, and green responses for each letter in the guess."

    "The basic rules for Wordle are for a guessed letter that matches the solution letter in the same position in the word the response is green.  For example if the solution is TENET and the guess is TRACE, then the first letter T will have a green response.  If a guessed letter is in the solution word but not in that position then the response is yellow.  Continuing our example the E in trace will have a yellow response since TENET has a letter E in it, but not as the fifth letter.  Finally if a guessed letter is not in the solution word then the response will be gray.  In our example the R, A, and C will all give gray responses since none of those letters are in the solution word TENET.  Pulling this all together our guess of TRACE will give as a response: green, gray, gray, gray, yellow."

    "The rules get slightly more complicated when there is a repeated letter however.  If the guess has a repeated letter and that letter does not appear at all in the solution then both the repeated guess letters will be gray.  If there is exactly 1 instance of the repeated letter in the solution then one of the guess letters will be gray and the other will be either green or yellow.  If there are 2 or more of the repeated letter in the solution then the repeated letter guess responses will be some combination of yellow and green with no gray."
